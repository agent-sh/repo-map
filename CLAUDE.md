## Commands

## Critical Rules

1. **Plain text output** - No emojis, no ASCII art. Use `[OK]`, `[ERROR]`, `[WARN]`, `[CRITICAL]` for status markers.
2. **No unnecessary files** - Don't create summary files, plan files, audit files, or temp docs.
3. **Task is not done until tests pass** - Every feature/fix must have quality tests.
4. **Create PRs for non-trivial changes** - No direct pushes to main.
5. **Always run git hooks** - Never bypass pre-commit or pre-push hooks.
6. **Use single dash for em-dashes** - In prose, use ` - ` (single dash with spaces), never ` -- `.
7. **Report script failures before manual fallback** - Never silently bypass broken tooling.
8. **Token efficiency** - Be concise. Save tokens over decorations.

## Model Selection

| Model | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| **Opus** | Complex reasoning, analysis, planning |
| **Sonnet** | Validation, pattern matching, most agents |
| **Haiku** | Mechanical execution, no judgment needed |

## Core Priorities

1. User DX (plugin users first)
2. Worry-free automation
3. Token efficiency
4. Quality output
5. Simplicity

## Dev Commands

```bash
npm test          # Run tests
npm run validate  # All validators
```
